    Hi there, I'm Ben! I am a Penultimate Software Engineering Student at the
    University of Auckland. For as long as I can remember, I've always had a
    passion for tech. Throughout my many years of schooling, that passion has
    been the driving force that has led me to where I am today. I am always
    ready to delve deeper into the field of Software Engineering and apply all
    that I have learned. My roots are in Tauranga, and I love nothing more than
    soaking in the sun at a good beach and getting outdoors. <br />
